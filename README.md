# HybridSamplers for ComfyUI

HybridSamplers is a **ComfyUI custom node extension** that introduces new experimental **samplers** and **schedulers** designed to give more control and flexibility over the diffusion process.

With HybridSamplers, you can explore alternative numerical methods, dynamic scheduling strategies, and experimental noise shaping — useful for research, experimentation, or pushing creative generation beyond standard defaults.

## 🔧 Installation

Clone into your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` folder:

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/azazeal04/ComfyUI-HybridSamplers.git
```
Install from manager
Search for HybridSamplers for ComfyUI in the manager and install it.


Restart ComfyUI and the new **samplers** and **schedulers** will be available in dropdown menus.

---

## 🛠 Development

* Python ≥ 3.10
* Torch ≥ 2.0
* Requires ComfyUI installed and working.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* These samplers/schedulers are **experimental** and may produce noisy or blurry results.
* Designed for testing new ideas in diffusion sampling, not guaranteed for production use.
* You can enable debug logs in the console to see when a custom sampler/scheduler is active.
